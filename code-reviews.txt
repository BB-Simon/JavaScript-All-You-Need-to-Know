3. You are leading the development of a new feature for a SaaS application. During code reviews, 
you notice inconsistencies in the use of design patterns and accessibility practices across
the codebase. 

How would you ensure that your team adheres to frontend development standards, 
including accessibility, performance optimization, and maintainable code structures?

Ensuring adherence to frontend development standards requires a structured approach combining education, tools, 
and processes. 
Here's how I would address the situation:

1. Establish a Frontend Guidelines Document
* Design pattern best practices
* Accessibility requirements (e.g., WCAG 2.1 compliance, semantic HTML usage).
* Performance optimization techniques  (e.g., lazy loading, code splitting).
* Naming conventions
* Component design standards.

2.  Implement automate Code Quality Checks:
* Integrate ESLint with custom rules to enforce coding standards
* Use Prettier for consistent code formatting
* Use pre-commit code formatting using Husky with Prettier
* Implement accessibility linting tools like:
  eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y for React applications
* Configure TypeScript with strict type checking to catch potential issues early
* Automated accessibility checkers in CI/CD pipelines
* Set up performance auditing tools like Lighthouse in the build process

3. Provide Training and Resources: like Educate the Team, Pair Programming and Mentorship
4. Improve the Code Review Process, like: Create a Review Checklist => mention microverse
5.  Refactor and Maintain the Codebase
