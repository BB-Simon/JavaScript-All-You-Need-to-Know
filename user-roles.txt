6. Your SaaS applicationâ€™s frontend requires integration with a new backend API for managing user roles
and permissions. The API is still under development, and its structure and response times are inconsistent. 

How would you handle this integration to minimize disruptions to the frontend while collaborating 
with the backend team to resolve these issues?

##Key Integration Strategies
  3. Fallback Roles: Define default roles to ensure basic functionality
    Use skeleton loaders during API calls
    Implement optimistic UI updates
    Provide clear error messages to users
    Gracefully handle scenarios where role/permission data is unavailable
    
  1. Caching Mechanism: Implement an in-memory cache to reduce API calls and 
  provide fallback data

  2. Retry Logic: Add exponential backoff for handling transient network issues
  
  4. Error Handling: Comprehensive error logging and graceful degradation


## Collaboration with Backend Team
API Contract Documentation
Work closely with backend team to define a clear, stable API contract
Use TypeScript interfaces to enforce type safety
Create comprehensive documentation for expected request/response structures

## Frontend Resilience Patterns


## Monitoring and Observability
Implement detailed error logging
Add performance tracking for API calls
Set up alerts for consistent failures or performance degradation


## Performance Optimization
Minimize unnecessary API calls
Implement intelligent caching strategies
Use background refresh for cached data
