I have been working for 5 years at Upwork Freelancer Marketplace as a remote software developer,

React, Node, Express, and MongoDB.

at 2023 July I graduated from Microverse, a remote software development school that trains talented devs 
from all over the world in a pair-programing and collaborative environment. I've spent the one year completely
immersed in remote development, building everything from landing pages to Rails APIs.

I started my journey to code at the fabruary of 2017, At That time I switched between several programming 
languages like C, Java, Python, and PHP to learn the fundamentals of programming.
